# Object-Detection-using-Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients
Object detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and sliding window in Python.
# ðŸŽ¯ Object Detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

This project implements **object detection using the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** feature descriptor and a **custom sliding window** approach. Designed for lightweight and real-time image processing tasks.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Feature extraction using HOG
- Sliding window for object localization
- Handles challenging conditions: lighting, scale, and rotation
- Designed for real-time use without deep learning

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- NumPy
- matplotlib

---

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Custom HOG + sliding window detection pipeline
- Works on grayscale and RGB images
- High accuracy (80â€“90%) under varied conditions
- Adaptable to detect objects from a template
